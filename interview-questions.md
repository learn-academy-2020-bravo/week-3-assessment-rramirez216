# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: storing the property of an object to a variable allowing it to be re-used

  Researched answer:

2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: value, index, array

  Researched answer:

    // return element for new_array
}[, thisArg])


3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: a class is a blueprint for an object

  Researched answer:
  A: A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value.An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: div is a block level element while the span tag is an inline container

  Researched answer:

  A: HTML <div> tag: The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content on the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). Div tag has both opening(<div>) and closing (</div>) tags and it is mandatory to close the tag. As we know Div tag is a block-level tag. In this example, the div tag contains the entire width. It will be displayed div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.
  HTML <span> tag: The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes). A better way to use it when no other semantic element is available. The span tag is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: the react fragment lets you write jsx and tells the browser what to print onto the page.
